# Implementation notes

Working notes for whoever picks this up next. SPEC.md is the contract; this file records
where the implementation had to choose.

## Topcoat deviations

- **Assets bypass `asset!`/`topcoat asset bundle`.** The spec requires that plain
  `cargo build` on a fresh clone produce a runnable server. Topcoat's asset bundler is a
  separate CLI step (`topcoat asset bundle`) that must run against the exact binary, so
  instead `build.rs` runs esbuild and the two bundles are embedded with `include_bytes!`
  and served from `/assets/...` routes with a content-hash query for cache busting.
- **A `shell` component instead of `#[layout]`.** Pages pass the title, the active tab,
  and the mirror status into the chrome. A path-prefix layout cannot take arguments from
  the page it wraps, so the chrome is an ordinary `#[component]` every page calls.
  Routing itself is idiomatic: `#[page]`/`#[route]` + `Router::builder().discover()`.
- **`topcoat::serve` with our own listener,** because the bind address comes from
  `NASHCODE_BIND`, not Topcoat's `HOST`/`PORT`.

## Routing decisions

- Branch names may contain `/`, so `/{repo}/{*rest}` is a catch-all and action suffixes
  are parsed off the tail: `.../ci`, `.../ci/rerun`, `.../merge`, `.../restack`,
  `.../delete`. A branch name therefore may not *end* in one of those suffixes.
- Reserved first segments under a repo (never valid branch names): `stacks`, `plans`,
  `tasks`, `board`, `ci`, `comments`, `raw`, `traces`, `commits`, `assets`. `tasks` and
  `commits` are reserved beyond the spec's list: a card page renders at
  `/{repo}/tasks/{*path}` and the commit-to-trace link at `/{repo}/commits/{sha}/trace`.
- `GET /{repo}/traces[...]` is both a page and an API: `Accept: application/json`
  selects JSON, anything else gets HTML. One URL per resource instead of a parallel
  `/api` tree.
- `/{repo}/raw/{*rest}`: the branch part of the rest is matched greedily against real
  branch names (longest prefix wins) so branches with `/` still get raw URLs; if nothing
  matches, the first segment is taken as the revision.

## Spec interpretation

- **Merge fast-forward:** when the parent's tip is an ancestor of the branch tip the
  merge fast-forwards; otherwise `git merge --no-ff` creates a merge commit.
- **Outdated comments:** a line-anchored comment is *outdated* when the branch tip moved
  past the comment's commit **and** the anchored file changed between the two commits
  (`git diff --quiet`). Comments on untouched files stay inline.
- **/brain/ask upstream errors:** a 429 from the Claude API passes through as 429 (it is
  actionable rate-limit information); every other upstream failure is a 502 carrying the
  API's own error message. The spec says "502, never 500"; the acceptance list says "429
  passthrough" — this satisfies both.
- **Restack pushes are atomic:** all rebases happen in a scratch clone first, then one
  `git push --force --atomic` pushes every new tip; a conflict aborts before any push.

## Known caveats

- **The JS bundle is ~10 MB unminified-by-content.** `@pierre/diffs` pulls in Shiki, and
  Shiki's default entry point carries every bundled grammar and theme. It gzips to a
  fraction of that and is cached after the first load, but it is the one number in this
  project that would embarrass you on a cold load over a slow link. The fix, if it ever
  matters: register only the languages the repos actually contain via
  `registerCustomLanguage` / `preloadHighlighter` and import Shiki's core entry instead of
  the full bundle. Not done here because it trades a real correctness property (any file
  in any language highlights) for a load-time number nobody on a tailnet will notice.
- **CI runs jobs serially** in one global worker, per the spec. The `// ponytail` marker
  at the queue notes where to parallelize per repo if it ever backs up.
- **`git` is assumed on `PATH`** at runtime, not just at build time. There is no
  vendored git and there never should be.

## Workspace overlap (post-publish work)

The viewer's agent-side subcommands (`nashcode-viewer hook`, `trace push/list/show`,
`doctor`) overlap conceptually with the `cli/` crate: both are client tools an agent
machine installs, both infer the repo from the working directory, both talk HTTP to a
server. They are deliberately NOT unified yet — the CLI talks to dgit, the viewer client
talks to the viewer, and merging the two surfaces is post-publish work, not a publish
blocker.

## Code intelligence choices (2026-08-19, from the research pass)

- **Graph: codanna + SCIP, hybrid.** codanna (Apache-2.0, `lib` crate, tree-sitter,
  covers our three languages) builds the graph on every push — fast and incremental,
  but name resolution is heuristic. SCIP is regenerated on merge as the accurate
  overlay (`rust-analyzer scip`, `scip-typescript`, `scip-python`) and read in-process
  with the first-party `scip` crate. Rejected: stack-graphs (archived 2025-09), Kythe
  (frozen since the 2024 layoffs), Glean (consumes SCIP anyway; heavy ops), GitLab gkg
  (maintenance mode, successor is EE-licensed).
- **Known costs:** rust-analyzer's SCIP pass is single-threaded
  (rust-analyzer#18140) — shard by crate and cache by blob SHA. `scip-python` is the
  worst-maintained of the three indexers; where it fails, that repo keeps codanna
  edges only. SCIP occurrences don't name the enclosing function; the range→symbol
  interval map is ours to build (~200 lines) and is what impact queries hang off.
- **Embeddings: `JinaEmbeddingsV2BaseCode`** — the one code-trained model fastembed
  ships (768-dim, Apache-2.0), and it beats the general-text models on code retrieval
  by a wide margin. Upgrade order when quality pinches: add fastembed's `TextRerank`
  over the top ~50 hits first; only then swap the encoder via
  `UserDefinedEmbeddingModel` (nomic-embed-code or CodeSage, local ONNX).
