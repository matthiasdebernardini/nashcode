# Implementation notes

Working notes for whoever picks this up next. SPEC.md is the contract; this file records
where the implementation had to choose.

## Topcoat deviations

- **Assets bypass `asset!`/`topcoat asset bundle`.** The spec requires that plain
  `cargo build` on a fresh clone produce a runnable server. Topcoat's asset bundler is a
  separate CLI step (`topcoat asset bundle`) that must run against the exact binary, so
  instead `build.rs` runs esbuild and the two bundles are embedded with `include_bytes!`
  and served from `/assets/...` routes with a content-hash query for cache busting.
- **A `shell` component instead of `#[layout]`.** Pages pass the title, the active tab,
  and the mirror status into the chrome. A path-prefix layout cannot take arguments from
  the page it wraps, so the chrome is an ordinary `#[component]` every page calls.
  Routing itself is idiomatic: `#[page]`/`#[route]` + `Router::builder().discover()`.
- **`topcoat::serve` with our own listener,** because the bind address comes from
  `NASHGIT_BIND`, not Topcoat's `HOST`/`PORT`.

## Routing decisions

- Branch names may contain `/`, so `/{repo}/{*rest}` is a catch-all and action suffixes
  are parsed off the tail: `.../ci`, `.../ci/rerun`, `.../merge`, `.../restack`,
  `.../delete`. A branch name therefore may not *end* in one of those suffixes.
- Reserved first segments under a repo (never valid branch names): `stacks`, `plans`,
  `tasks`, `board`, `ci`, `comments`, `raw`. `tasks` is reserved beyond the spec's list
  because a card page renders at `/{repo}/tasks/{*path}` (spec only names `board`).
- `/{repo}/raw/{*rest}`: the branch part of the rest is matched greedily against real
  branch names (longest prefix wins) so branches with `/` still get raw URLs; if nothing
  matches, the first segment is taken as the revision.

## Spec interpretation

- **Merge fast-forward:** when the parent's tip is an ancestor of the branch tip the
  merge fast-forwards; otherwise `git merge --no-ff` creates a merge commit.
- **Outdated comments:** a line-anchored comment is *outdated* when the branch tip moved
  past the comment's commit **and** the anchored file changed between the two commits
  (`git diff --quiet`). Comments on untouched files stay inline.
- **/brain/ask upstream errors:** a 429 from the Claude API passes through as 429 (it is
  actionable rate-limit information); every other upstream failure is a 502 carrying the
  API's own error message. The spec says "502, never 500"; the acceptance list says "429
  passthrough" — this satisfies both.
- **Restack pushes are atomic:** all rebases happen in a scratch clone first, then one
  `git push --force --atomic` pushes every new tip; a conflict aborts before any push.

## Scratch files

`.probe*.js` and `.aliastest/` were the previous agent's import experiments against
`@pierre/diffs` (confirming `FileDiff`/`parsePatchFiles` are importable from the package
root). Safe to delete.
